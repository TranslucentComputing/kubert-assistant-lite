## Key Features

- **Kind Cluster Deployment**: Leverage Kubernetes in Docker (Kind) to create a local Kubernetes cluster for testing and development, enabling rapid prototyping and experimentation.
- **Kubectl AI Agent**: An AI-powered agent capable of executing `kubectl` commands based on user prompts. This agent enhances productivity by automating routine Kubernetes management tasks.
- **Automation and Insights**: Gain insights into your Kubernetes environment through automated command execution and analysis provided by the AI agent.

The architecture of Kubert AI Assistant Lite consists of several key components that work together to create a robust and flexible local Kubernetes environment using Kind. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

- **Local Environment**: The project is initiated on the developer's machine, which runs Docker to host the Kubernetes cluster using Kind. This setup ensures a lightweight and easily configurable development environment.

- **Kind Cluster**: Kind (Kubernetes in Docker) is used to create a local Kubernetes environment within Docker containers. It provides a lightweight and configurable cluster setup, ideal for testing and development purposes.

- **Kubert AI Assistant**: Deployed within the Kind cluster, the Kubert Assistant serves as a management layer that interprets user prompts and coordinates actions within the cluster. It acts as a bridge between user commands and Kubernetes operations.

- **Kubectl AI Agent**: This AI-powered agent operates within the Kind cluster, executing `kubectl` commands based on natural language prompts. It offers automated management and diagnostic capabilities, simplifying Kubernetes operations and enhancing productivity.

- **User Interaction**: Users send commands through a prompt interface, which are interpreted by the Kubectl AI Agent to perform the necessary operations within the Kubernetes cluster.

This architecture enables seamless interaction and automation within a localized Kubernetes environment, making it an ideal tool for developers and DevOps professionals looking to streamline their Kubernetes workflows.

The Kubert AI Assistant Lite project is organized into several key components, each contributing to the overall functionality and structure of the project. Below is a breakdown of these components, aligned with the project tree structure:

- **Project Root**: The top-level directory containing all project files and directories. It serves as the entry point for the entire project.

  - **Makefile**: A build automation tool file containing a set of directives used to compile and manage the project. It simplifies complex command sequences, making it easier for developers to execute tasks.

  - **README.md**: A markdown file providing an overview of the project, including usage instructions, setup steps, and additional resources for users and contributors.

  - **kind-config.yaml**: Configuration file used to set up the Kind Kubernetes cluster, defining the cluster's specifications and resources.

- **Scripts**: A directory containing various shell scripts used to automate deployment, cleanup, validation, and other utility functions.

  - **cleanup.sh**: Script for cleaning up resources and reverting changes made during deployment.

  - **deploy.sh**: Script to deploy the Kubert Assistant Lite application onto the Kubernetes cluster.

  - **utils.sh**: Contains reusable utility functions shared across multiple scripts to enhance efficiency and consistency.

  - **validate-tools.sh**: Validates the presence and versions of required tools, ensuring that all prerequisites are met before proceeding with operations.

- **Manifests**: A directory containing YAML files and Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments and configurations.

  - **calico**: Includes deployment configurations for Calico, a networking and network policy engine for Kubernetes.

  - **chart**: Contains Helm chart files, including templates and values used to deploy and manage Kubernetes components.
